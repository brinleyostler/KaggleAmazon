# Kaggle Amazon Employee Access Challenge
This repository contains the R script used for my participation in the Kaggle Amazon Employee Access Challenge. The goal of the competition was to predict the resource access permissions required for a new employee based on historical employee access data.

This project aims to develop a predictive model for determining the access permissions needed by new employees based on their job roles and historical access data. The model helps in automating the process of granting access to various resources, improving efficiency and security.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle and includes the following features:

**ACTION:** Access granted (1) or not (0)

**RESOURCE:** Resource ID

**MGR_ID:** Manager ID

**ROLE_ROLLUP_1:** Role rollup 1

**ROLE_ROLLUP_2:** Role rollup 2

**ROLE_DEPTNAME:** Role department name

**ROLE_TITLE:** Role title

**ROLE_FAMILY_DESC:** Role family description

**ROLE_FAMILY:** Role family

**ROLE_CODE:** Role code


## Model
To view all models I experimented with for this competition, look through the Git history for the AmazonAnalysis.R file.
